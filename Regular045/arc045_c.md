We have a tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N. The i-th edge in this tree connects Vertex a_i and b_i, and has a cost of c_i.
We define Xorsum of {A_1, A,2,...} as A_1 xor A_2 xor ....
Find the number of pairs of (a, b) (1 <= a < b <= N) such as Xorsum of costs on the path from a to b equals to X.
